I’m a Product Design Consultant with 5+ years of working with early-stage and mid-stage startups in various industries. I graduated from <a class="heavy green" href="https://www.iitg.ac.in/design/">Department of Design, IIT Guwahati</a> in 2018. <br/><br/>I love learning new stuff. That’s right! Hit me up with a random topic and there’s a good chance I’ll be interested in discussing it with you. But most of all, it’s the human behaviour which intrigues me. And understanding that is where I spend most of time. I also adore development, and you can find me <a class="dev-link" href="https://codepen.io/priyank1205/">playing around with React.js now and then.</a><br/><br/>I enjoy two very generic things. Pizza 🍕and Beer 🍺. Top that up with some good books 📚, and you’d have just made my day. I also appreciate people who love and are fully immersed in their crafts. Again, human behaviour, you see.<br/><br/>If you’d like to play CS:GO with me, ping me on Steam	and if you have some side projects in mind, I’d love to have a chat. <br/>Peace!</div></div><div class="buttons" id="mobile-btns"><button class="secondary-btn">BACK TO PORTFOLIO</button><button class="primary-btn">LET'S TALK!</button></div></div></div></body><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
