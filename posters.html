Georg Ohm's Birth Anniversary</div><div class="project-description">The first poster I made that got published on the facebook page of the technical fest was for Georg Ohm's 226th birth anniversary. Ohm was famous for Ohm's Law, and I decided to show the Ohm's Law being applied on a circuit in the shape of his name.</div><div class="project-description">It was my first time experimenting with the Adobe CC Suite and digital compositions. The poster came out quite clean, and was appreciated.</div><img class="project-img" src="./img/Ohm.jpg"/><div class="project-subheading">2. Amelia Earheart's birth anniversary</div><div class="project-description">Similar to the Georg Ohm's Poster, a poster was scheduled to be released for the birth anniversary of Amelia Earheart, the first female aviator to have crossed the Atlantic Ocean.</div><div class="project-description">This time, I chose to play with her name, and to create a quote out of it. Also, since it had a very feministic significance, I chose warm, unsaturated colors.</div><img class="project-img" src="./img/amelia.png"/><div class="project-subheading">3. Low Poly Portrait</div><div class="project-description">The introduction posters for the personalities coming for Industrial Conclave, Techniche'16 were planned to use low poly portraits of the personalities.</div><div class="project-description">I was tasked to make a low poly portrait of Neil WIlson, COO, PWO India. I had no clue what a low poly portrait was, and the whole process took me over 12 hours, but the final outcome was oddly satisfying.</div><img class="project-img" src="./img/lowPoly.png"/><div class="project-subheading">4. Father's Day</div><div class="project-description">On the ocassion of Father's Day, I planned to surprise my Dad by making a poster for him. I made a Google Search Suggestions page with the suggestions showing what I felt about him.</div><div class="project-description">This was my first encounter with the Chrome Inspector Panel, and I ripped off the fonts and colors used on the Google Landing page, and made almost everything vector. My Dad was elated on seeing the poster, and it also proved that I was learning something, for the very least.</div><img class="project-img" src="./img/google.jpg"/><a class="back-btn rnd-btn" href="index.html#portfolio">Back to Portfolio</a><a class="contact-btn rnd-btn" href="contact.html">Let's Talk!</a></div></div><div class="project-nav"><a class="previous project-nav-section" href="youtube.html"><i class="prev-icon"></i><span class="label">YOUTUBE</span></a><a class="next project-nav-section" href="pakit.html"><i class="next-icon"></i><span class="label">PAKIT</span></a></div></body></html>
