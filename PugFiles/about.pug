              | I am an interaction designer currently attending design school at
              span.italic  Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.
              |  I thrive on human-computer interaction and love to create intuitive and seamless experiences for people.

              | Human Psychology has always intrigued me and I've tried to keep up with the ever-changing technology. I enjoy making stuff as much as designing and prototyping them.
