            | I love learning new stuff. That‚Äôs right! Hit me up with a random topic and there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôll be interested in discussing it with you. But most of all, it‚Äôs the human behaviour which intrigues me. And understanding that is where I spend most of time. I also adore development, and you can find me 
            a.dev-link(href = 'https://codepen.io/priyank1205/') playing around with React.js now and then.

            | I enjoy two very generic things. Pizza üçïand Beer üç∫. Top that up with some good books üìö, and you‚Äôd have just made my day. I also appreaciate people who love their crafts and are fully immersed in them. Again, human behaviour, you see.
