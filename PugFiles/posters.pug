        .project-subheading 1. Georg Ohm's Birth Anniversary
        .project-description The first poster I made that got published on the facebook page of the technical fest was for Georg Ohm's 226th birth anniversary. Ohm was famous for Ohm's Law, and I decided to show the Ohm's Law being applied on a circuit in the shape of his name.
